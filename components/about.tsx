                    <p className='text-base leading-7'>Back in 2020, as a Novice, I started self-learning things online from complete fundamentals and then got really interested in coding with C and C++. And things got even more exciting as I was discovering web development and all the cool frameworks out there. Fast forward to today and I&apos;ve had the privilege of building software for an <span className='font-extrabold'>car agency</span>, a <span className='font-extrabold'>start-up</span>, and multiple products for clients in a <span className='font-extrabold'>huge corporation</span>.</p>

                    <p className='text-base leading-7'>My main focus in current organization is building accessible user interfaces for our clients at <span className='font-extrabold'>Accenture</span>. I enjoy building software in the sweet spot where design and engineering meet â€” things that look <span className='font-extrabold'>great</span> and are also <span className='font-extrabold'>well-made</span> under the hood.</p>
